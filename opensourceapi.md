## SIA's Open Source API

Citizens around the world depend on government issued identities to prove who they are and gain access to vital services, including healthcare, social protection, education and finance. 

The ability to uniquely identify individuals and reliable authenticate identity is a key enabler for accelerating progress toward achieving the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Indeed, robust and reliable ID systems generate tangible benefits across a range of areas – everything from the provision of the political, social and economic services every citizen has the right to expect, to improving national security and enabling new, more efficient ways for government and business to reach and serve the population.

It is therefore crucial that governments can ensure citizens are the same person across all their registries and issuing agencies, and that an individual’s data – or attributes – are up-to-date. Doing so protects the individual against the risk of identity theft, and state agencies against fraud.

It is this imperative that’s currently driving governments around the globe to rollout national ID systems in which multiple ID registries and systems, serving different functions, operate together as a cohesive whole.

### 1. The ID harmonization challenge – the need for technical standards

Many of today’s national ID systems are composed of scattered registries that perform different functions:
* Civil Registration – which manages vital events such as live births, partnerships, separation and deaths, and includes key biographic information about an individual.
* Civil Identification – which often includes biometrics and is the basis for a national ID card.
* Functional systems and registers – such a voters’ rolls, land registry, passport, vehicle registry, residence registry, education, health, benefits, police and judiciary.

But bringing these scattered registries together in a cost-effective and sustainable manner is a not inconsiderable task.

Frequently, the databases that underpin these individual systems are not interoperable – making it impossible to exchange, consult or update data between systems and hindering the development of cohesive ID ecosystems.

With no standardized way to connect registries, identity system vendors often develop their own ad hoc interfaces, based on proprietary technology. It’s an approach that creates vendor ‘lock-in’ scenarios that potentially leave governments with limited options should they need to evolve their ID ecosystems.

This has proved particularly challenging for those tasked with delivering national ID schemes in the developing world, where, governments often face a stark choice: abandon existing legacy investments and start again from scratch.

Making it both complex and cost-prohibitive to progress towards the UN’s SDG goal of empowering citizens and promoting peaceful and inclusive societies by providing universal legal identity to all.

### 2. Open Source API – the pathway to harmonization

To address this issue, the SIA – a not-for-profit association supported by the world’s leading identity providers - is developing an Open Source Application Program Interface (API) that enables otherwise non-compatible ID systems to ‘talk’ to one another.

Resolving the interoperability and data sharing challenges created by the current lack of universal technical standards, the Open Source API is:
* Open source and will be published in GitHub – making it available to all
* Vendor neutral – developed by a consortium of vendors, it will be maintained via a collaborative and consensus-driven process
* An architecture-neutral solution that preserves legacy systems – the API operates over the top of existing repositories, so governments are no longer obliged to discard existing ID solutions

### 3. Towards a sustainable future

The Open Source API initiative ushers in a new era of openness and collaboration between major players in the identity industry that will eliminate the interoperability challenges that have, until now, hampered the evolution of national identity systems. 

Supported by all major ID vendors, the Open Source API makes it possible for governments and implementing bodies across the world to invest with confidence. Initiating robust identification platforms for their citizens, preserving the value of existing systems while evolving their environments without fear of vendor lock-in.

_“The importance of initiatives of this type cannot be underestimated,” confirms Dr Joseph Atick, Executive Chairman of the ID4Africa Movement. “Governments and implementing bodies must be free to select the most appropriate solutions, without commercial or technical restrictions. The SIA’s Open Source API is a key enabler and a major step towards harmonizing identity schemes across Africa.”_
