## Our mission

Secure Identity Alliance is dedicated to supporting the provision of legal, trusted identity
for all, and to drive the development of inclusive digital services necessary for sustainable,
worldwide economic growth and prosperity.

We believe legal, trusted identity is the cornerstone of rights protection, social inclusion and
digital economic development - and the access point to a wide range of essential public and
private services.

We bring together public, private and non-government organizations to foster international
collaboration on the issues of legal identity, to help shaping policy and to provide technical
and implementation guidance for national and international ID systems

We support the goals of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

We support the World Bank Group Identification for Development (ID4D) Program’s Principles
on Identification for Sustainable Development Towards the Digital Age (as an early contributor
and endorser).

We support the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

We are a member of the coalition advocating September 16 as International Identity Day (commemorating SDG 16.9).

We are driving the development of international, open standards (as our members have for
over 40 years).

Over 85% of the world’s population is covered through multiple applications by our members’
technologies.

Our members have committed to the Secure Identity Alliance’s Code of Conduct.
